Instructions for using:
- Runs as Java application on command line (main class is RomanNumeralParser)
- Input is either Roman numeral in lowercase or uppercase letters (e.g. "vi" or "MCMLXXXIV"), or an empty line to quit. 
- Program checks for invalid characters in input string as well as malformatted numerals (e.g. "IIII" should be "IV", "VV" should be "X", etc.)
- Decimal values for valid Roman numerals are returned as text output, e.g. "The decimal value of "xcv" is 95."
